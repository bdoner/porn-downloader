# porn-downloader
Fetch some pictures from the SFW porn network on reddit.. Or any subreddit you might desire. And then sort the images by their ratio for easy wallpaper-use.

# Requirements
 * Run `bundle install` before first run
 * Set your `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable to point to the included `cacert.pem` file

# protip
Set up a weekly scheduler task in windows or a cron on linux for eternal fresh wallpapers

# todo
 * Use fastimage on the remote-image and skip downloading if it's too small
 * Use parameters for things instead of contants
 * Make it a bit more pretty.. maybe
